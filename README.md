MeshroomCL
==========
MeshroomCL is an extension of the [Meshroom](https://alicevision.org/)
photogrammetry software developed by the AliceVision project. Meshroom
and MeshroomCL provide an interface to algorithms for reconstructing 3D
models from collections of images. While the original Meshroom required
CUDA to achieve accelerated performance, MeshroomCL adds components
based on the OpenCL API and can run on a variety of GPU platforms
(AMD, Intel, NVIDIA, etc.).
